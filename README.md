# SupportVectorMachine_with_Diff_KernelsAndParameters
This repository includes two Python scripts, SVM_EX-1 and SVM_EX-2, demonstrating the use of Support Vector Machines (SVM) for breast cancer classification. The scripts perform data loading, preprocessing, exploration, model training, and evaluation.
